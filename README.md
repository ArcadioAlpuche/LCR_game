## What I Learned
This was a school project that allowed me to test my general coding knowledge. The number one take away for me was the importance of arrays and how to use them effectively. The number of players, player names, and chip values are all stored in arrays. I used loops to iterate through each array index which allowed me to display the correct players name and chip count, as well as move chips to the correct player based on the dice value.
